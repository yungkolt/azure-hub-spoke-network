## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

This repository contains a complete implementation of Microsoft Azure's recommended hub-and-spoke network architecture, designed for enterprise-scale deployments with security, scalability, and operational excellence in mind.

### 🎯 Key Features

- **Enterprise Security**: Zero-trust network design with Azure Firewall and NSGs
- **Scalable Architecture**: Modular spoke design for easy expansion
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Multiple deployment options (ARM, Terraform, Scripts)
- **Monitoring & Observability**: Comprehensive logging and alerting
- **Cost Optimization**: Right-sized resources with cost monitoring
- **Well-Documented**: Detailed documentation and runbooks

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Azure subscription with Contributor access
- Azure CLI or PowerShell installed
- Terraform (optional, for Terraform deployment)

### Deploy with Azure CLI
